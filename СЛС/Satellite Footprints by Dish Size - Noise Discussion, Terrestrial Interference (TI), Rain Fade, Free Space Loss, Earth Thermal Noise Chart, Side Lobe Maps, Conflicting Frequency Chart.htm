      we are talking about unwanted<IMG height=236

      width=216 align=right border=2 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> signal. We 'break out' 
      noise into three basic categories; that is background noise, modulated 
      noise and interference noise. Background noise is the noise we always want 
      to stay above, it is sometimes called the 'noise floor'. Signal can always 
      be amplified above the noise floor but once it gets buried in background 
      noise (falls into the signal floor) it can not be retrieved; this is why 
      the LNB amplifies the weak satellite signals as soon as they are received 
      before passing them on into the cable and to your receiver. Modulated 
      noise is undesireable signal that enters into a system and rides on a 
      signal, using your system power, producing undesireable side effects in 
      video quality. Interference is noise that comes in on the same 
      frequency(ies) as signal and masks (overwhelms) parts or all of the 
      desired signal (<A 
      href="http://www.geo-orbit.org/sizepgs/Noise.html#anchor4293075957">see 
      diagram</A>).<BR><B><I><A

      <P><B>BACKGROUND and SYSTEM NOISE:</B><A name=anchor2010108></A>We live in 
      a world composed of atoms and molecules and although an object, such as a 
      rock or a circuitboard, may appear motionless in reality inside it is 
      'jumping around' with molecular motion. This ceaseless molecular motion 
      emits (gives off) energy, i.e. generates electromagnetic fields, and 
      portions of this energy are in the microwave range. So in a microwave 
      system (which is what a satellite system is) there will always be a level 
      of detectable noise (background noise) inherent to the system and this 
      noise is the internal noise of that system and we call that base level of 
      noise the noise floor - it is impossible to go below a noise floor except 
      by lowering the temperature of the unit to absolute zero which is the 
      point where all molecular motion ceases. (Absolue zero is minus 459.69F or 
      minus 273.16C.) However, we try to lower the noise floor of electronics 
      through better circuitry design. For instance, an LNB is rated in 'noise 
      temperature' (in degrees Kelvin) and <IMG height=158 
      alt="Satellite Footprints by Dish Size - Noise Discussion, Terrestrial Interference (TI), Rain Fade, Free Space Loss, Earth Thermal Noise Chart, Side Lobe Maps, Conflicting Frequency Chart " 
      src="Satellite Footprints by Dish Size - Noise Discussion, Terrestrial Interference (TI), Rain Fade, Free Space Loss, Earth Thermal Noise Chart, Side Lobe Maps, Conflicting Frequency Chart.files/lnbcrr.gif" 
      width=221 align=right border=2 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">this is a value 
      indicative of the noise floor of that unit - this is the noise the LNB 
      contributes to the system. It basically means that any signal that passes 
      through the LNB will have to be above that rated value or the LNB will not 
      detect it and if the signal can not be detected then the LNB can not 
      operate on it.. Old timers in the satellite industry will remember the 
      first C-band LNBs had ratings of 100+ degrees and now we are using LNBs 
      with ratings of 25 degrees or less - this change in LNB noise floor is due 
      to advances in circuitry design, component isolation, semicondutor 
      efficiency, crystal growth, external coatings, etc. Internal heat in power 
      supplies, amplifiers, etc., also generate noise. All units that a signal 
      passes through - amplifiers, splitters, frequency converters, etc, - add 
      noise to the signal. Detectable noise can also be generated through 
      electric motors (I have seen a broken motor mount generate a spurious 
      signal that modulated onto the desired signal), neon lights and even 
      defective automotive ignition systems. The bottom line to a satellite 
      owner is that when the noise floor of a system is lowered then weaker 
      signals can be efficiently processed through the system and the smaller 
      satellite dish is required.<BR><B><I><A

      <P><B>EARTH THERMAL NOISE:</B> <A name=anchor358728></A>Another 
      contributor (component) to background noise is random noise - naatural 
      noise that is not related to system equipment. One thing to remember, the 
      satellite dish itself receives random <IMG height=248

      src="Satellite Footprints by Dish Size - Noise Discussion, Terrestrial Interference (TI), Rain Fade, Free Space Loss, Earth Thermal Noise Chart, Side Lobe Maps, Conflicting Frequency Chart.files/ele3r.gif" 
      width=379 align=right border=2 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">noise from the earth in 
      addition to signals from space, this random noise is often called <B>earth 
      thermal noise</B>. Earth noise is something we can not control and is 
      generated by the same internal molecular motion of all matter as is the 
      case in system electronics. Therefore, when the dish is at its peak (i.e. 
      not looking at the ground - over the horizon) it is receiving less earth 
      thermal noise than when it is positioned looking out on the horizon. Thus, 
      lower end satellites will always show a weaker signal than higher arc 
      satellites - all things being equal - because more earth noise is being 
      received at the same time low end arc satellite signal is being received 
      than when top of the arc satellites are being received. If your satellites 
      of interest are on the low end of the arc and those satellites are 
      delivering weaker signals to your system after your best efforts at tuning 
      the dish, then you will require a larger diameter dish though installing 
      the best rated LNB you can afford might overcome this. Note, a larger 
      diameter dish will take in more thermal noise, of course, but the 
      increased satellite signals it will gather are more significant than the 
      increased thermal noise it will pick up. (<A 
      href="http://www.geo-orbit.org/sizepgs/Noise.html#anchor4293005989">Side 
      lobes</A> of a larger dish are smaller in comparison to its main lobe so a 
      larger dish receives less per cent noise per signal as compared to a 
      smaller dish and, as the chart indicates, consequently shows to receive 
      less noise than a smaller dish so that a larger diameter satellite dish is 
      the clue to overcoming weak signals from low end of the arc 
      satellites.)<BR><B><I><A

      <P><B>FREE SPACE LOSS:</B> <A name=anchor716233></A>Not all low end signal 
      loss is due to increased earth thermal noise reception; low end satellites 
      pass through more atmosphere to reach your dish than high end satellites 
      and that reduces low end satellite signal strength; this is called free 
      space signal loss. Note in the free space path loss chart, the higher the

      width=218 align=right border=2 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">frequency, i.e. Ku-band 
      over C-band, the greater the signal attenuation. Because the satellite at 
      the top of the arc is the one you are closest to, there is more distance 
      from your dish to the end of the arc satellite than to the top of the arc 
      satellite so end of arc signals travel through more free space and have 
      more free space signal loss. The distance to a satellite from a receiving 
      location is called the slant path distance (slant range, slant path) and 
      the greater the slant path distance the greater the free space loss. In 
      addition to horizontal differential slant path losses there are latitude 
      losses which mean that locations at the higher latitudes have a greater 
      slant path to the satellite belt than do satellites at the equator and 
      therefore have more free space signal loss than equatorial receiving 
      locations. In summary, the more a signal passes through earth atmosphere 
      (the greater the slant path), whether in clear weather or through rain or 
      whether it be C-band or Ku-band, the greater will be signal attenuation 
      and the greatest attenuation will always be at the higher frequencies. 
      Free space loss does not cause noise to enter your system but it does 
      prevent signal from being as strong as you may require. The combination of 
      free space loss and <A 
      href="http://www.geo-orbit.org/sizepgs/Noise.html#anchor358728">earth 
      thermal noise</A> are the reason that after all the best efforts at tuning 
      your dish the low end satellites are still being received at less signal 
      quality - if this is the case with your system, and the low end satellites 
      are very important to you then you will need a larger satellite 
      dish.<BR><B><I><A

      the greatest single event reduction in power of signal is caused by rain, 
      not so much water vapor, i.e. humidity and fog. Since rain only forms in 
      the troposphere, which extends seven miles above the earth, and satellites 
      in geostationary orbit are 35,800 km above the earth, a signal travelling 
      through a rain cell will experience attenuation during only a small 
      portion of its transmission path. In fact, terrestrial microwave 
      transmissions are more susceptible to the effects of rain<BR>attenuation 
      because their signal paths are entirely in the troposphere, and the signal 
      may pass through an entire rain cell. In general, C-band signals to be 
      affected would require rain storms approaching hurricane conditions. I 
      have watched C-band in tremendous thunderstorms in Houston, i.e. in the 
      prime footprint, with no change in reception whatsoever; however, here in 
      Mexico on the same satellite in same intensity of rain the signal was 
      degraded a letter grade in quality. And in both locations, when the system 
      was tuned, the video quality rating on the descrambler said reception 
      is100% . The point being, obviously, the more marginal you are in the EIRP 
      footprint, the more effect rain will have on C-band regardless of what

      width=233 align=right border=2 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Professionals use rain 
      zonal maps (the USA map is produced by NASA) and rainfall-time intensity 
      maps to calculate what 99.9% availability would be for a dish system to 
      receive distribution quality signals. They take the 0.1% of the time rain 
      rate and insert that value into link budget equations in their dish size 
      calculations. For C-band it is not as critical, in regards to Ku-band, 
      however, the diameter of a rain drop is definitely detrimental to passage 
      of Ku/Ka-band signals. In the above referred to Houston storm, Ku was down 
      a grade in video quality whereas here in Mexico it was wiped out 
      completely - and I have top grade Ku video reception on clear days here in 
      Mexico and top grade Ku equipment. However on ultrafoggy days, here in 
      Mexico, I have noted no degradation of either C or Ku band reception so 
      the conclusion is that signal loss through fog is a minimal practical 
      concern. In regards to diameter of the raindrop, signal attenuation is 
      proportional to the wavelength of signal frequency and the size of the 
      raindrop through which the signal has to pass. Transmissions at C-band 
      have a longer wavelength than transmissions at Ku band, and are therefore 
      less susceptible to rain attenuation. For example, a C-band frequency has 
      a wave-length of approximately 7 cm, and a Ku-band frequency has a 
      wavelength of approximately 2 cm. Any raindrop in the path of either 
      signal which approached half the wavelength in diameter, will cause 
      attenuation. It is to be noted, Ku-band attenuation in rain is 
      approximately nine times that of C-band or 9:1dB - for each one dB loss in 
      C-band expect nines times that on Ku (remember that each 3dB signal loss 
      is a halving in power). Note rain attenuation effect on Ku-band with 
      change in dish look angle - the conclusion being that there is less loss 
      at greater look angles. As you know, this angle is dependent on the 
      latitude and longitude of the earth station. The lower the latitude of the 
      earth station the higher the elevation angle, and the less atmosphere 
      through which signals travel. The higher the latitude, the lower the 
      angle, and, therefore, the more atmosphere through which a signal must 
      travel and the greater the probability of it having to travel through 
      rain. Rain fade does not cause noise to enter your system but it does 
      prevent signal from being as strong as you may require.<BR><B><I><A

      <P><B>TERRESTRIAL INTERFERENCE:</B><A name=anchor31113></A>Terrestrial 
      interference (TI) occurs when a home satellite system receives unwanted 
      microwave signals from a nearby microwave source operating in the same 
      band of frequencies as the received satellite signal. The most common 
      source of TI comes from microwave relays (towers) operated <IMG height=178 
      alt="Satellite Footprints by Dish Size - Noise Discussion, Terrestrial Interference (TI), Rain Fade, Free Space Loss, Earth Thermal Noise Chart, Side Lobe Maps, Conflicting Frequency Chart " 
      src="Satellite Footprints by Dish Size - Noise Discussion, Terrestrial Interference (TI), Rain Fade, Free Space Loss, Earth Thermal Noise Chart, Side Lobe Maps, Conflicting Frequency Chart.files/towersr.gif" 
      width=370 align=left border=2 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">by telephone companies 
      in the C-band range, although airport navigation systems also can disrupt 
      satellite reception at all frequencies - especially near miliary 
      installations in countries without a clear frequency coordinating 
      authority in their central government. TI is a land based phenomena 
      generated by land based microwave relays and broadcasts transmitting in 
      the same frequency range as satellite downlinks. Because land based 
      transmissions are much more powerful (and nearby to your equipment) than 
      space based satellite transmissions, land microwave signals will dominate 
      into your receiving equipment and this unwanted signal reception by a 
      satellite antenna system is termed TI. Telephone company relays, i.e. 
      microwave tower to microwave tower single carrier transmissions, are the 
      most common source of TI because they were allocated the C-band frequency 
      range before satellites were in existence and the first satellites built 
      were to accomodate (and built by) telephone companies so as to provide a 
      means to transmit telephone traffic over great distances. The irony and 
      benefit of the situation is that most telephone traffic has moved from 
      satellite carriers for long distance transmission services to fiber optic 
      carriers. In 1965, when Intelsat 1, Early Bird (<A 
      href="http://www.geo-orbit.org/sizepgs/geodef.html#anchor1302357">satellite 
      history</A>), was launched, the satellite provided almost 10 times the 
      capacity of the then submarine telephone cables for almost 1/10th the 
      price. This price-differential was maintained until the laying of TAT-8 in 
      the late 1980s. (TAT-8 was the first fiber-optic cable laid across the 
      Atlantic.) Satellites are still competitive with cable for point-to-point 
      communications, but the advantages have been shifting to fiber-optic cable 
      for telephony traffic in more and more point-to-point applications. 
      Satellites still maintain two advantages over cable in that they are more 
      reliable and they can be used in point-to-multi-point (broadcasting) 
      applicatons. The benefit of the shift in telephony traffic to fiber optic 
      cable situation is that microwave land towers have drastically been 
      decommissioned, thus numerous TI sources have been eliminated. But by no 
      means are telephone microwave transmission the only potential TI source. 
      TI can be at the frequencies of direct detection through the LNB or be at 
      lower frequencies which enter your system at points other than direct 
      detection by the dish.</P>
      <P>Detection of potential direct entrance TI can be as simple as

      frequency patterns, and reflected interference (scattered from nearby 
      buildings or walls, etc.) you will typically see a series of spikes and

      Noise interference other than in-band noise, i.e. not in the direct 
      satellite reception frequency range, will appear as diagonal interference 
      lines across the TV and sometimes can be the cause of ghost images. Any 
      output port in an audio/video distribution system must end in a device, 
      example being a TV or 75ohm terminator. Terminators trick the cable into

      wavelengths are sufficiently short that they can enter a system through 
      poorly shielded electronic cases or directly into openings, i.e. non 
      terminated connections. (NOTE: The wavelength is 2/10 of an inch at 
      300MHz.) If 'loose' signals are out there wandering around, and they find 
      an entrance into your system, they will take it and then use their power 
      to travel with your signals in a modulated fashion or corrupt your signal 
      by adding to the noise floor, a very simple fact.</P>
      <P>Some LNB received TI will be distorted from its original frequency and 
      muddled in its amplitude due to reflections and scattering, or because it 
      is generated at non-standard frequencies, and will appear in-band to the 
      desired signal but sufficiently off center from signal (see adjacent 
      diagram) to avoid major signal interference.</P>
      <P>In general, TI can enter through unterminated cable ends, poorly 
      grounded connectors, open equipment cases, impedance mismatches and 
      directly through the LNB and can either contribute to the noise floor or 
      modulate their pattern onto your signal or interfere directly (replace) 
      with received signal. It is the latter TI, direct in-band TI that replaces 
      signal, which is the killer and which we are primarily looking for in a 
      choosing an installation location.</P>
      <P>It is good practice, in addition to specifically pointing the LNB 
      directly to a visible tower, to 'sweep', i.e. scan, the LNB 360 degrees 
      around the installation site to check for unwanted in-band signal such as 
      reflected from nearby buildings/walls, etc. (Be sure to note the 
      directions of all noise.sources.) Make two sweeps each one with the LNB 
      held orthogonal (ninety degrees) from the other to be sure you are 
      checking both polarities - maximum TI might be coming in at a skew. <IMG

      can check that the source is really TI by placing your hand over the LNB 
      at which time the offending signal should disappear from detection; if 
      not, the test equipment is malfunctioning (low battery or whatnot). TI 
      often enters from an off-axis angle, through a dish side lobe (see <A

      (if using a spectrum analyzer) which will tell you which satellite

      omits TI detection analysis, especially in urban areas, can result in a 
      'messy' situation after installation. Any customer that is counting on

      The deeper the satellite dish, i.e. the less the F/D ratio of the dish, 
      the more narrow will be its acceptance of satellite signals and the less 
      chance unwanted signals will enter the feed assembly. Simply stated, the 
      deeper the satellite dish, the closer the feed assembly is to the center 
      of the dish and this physical attribute of dish design lessens the amount 
      of unwanted signal which can enter the LNB. You can see from the chart, at 
      F/D=0.25 how difficult it is for signals from the outer edges of the dish 
      to enter the feedhorn; a deeper dish gathers less signal thereby has less 
      gain than a shallower dish (the greater the value of F/D then the 
      shallower the dish and the greater the gain) but has greater off-axis 
      signal rejection. A dish is considered deep with F/D ratios of 0.25 to 
      0.32 and is considered shallow with F/D ratios of 0.33 to 0.45. The actual 
      parabolic design (from one dish to the other) actually determines the

      made by measuring the physical dish signal response characteristics (i.e., 
      the dish is outfitted with a feed and LNB) to a known test signal. The 
      test signal is aimed at the stationary dish and at regular intervals, as 
      the test microwave source is physically rotated around the dish a full 
      three hundred sixty degrees, its per cent reception by the dish, as 
      compared to the known test signal generated by the test source, is 
      monitored and recorded. The recorded data is then plotted in intensity, as 
      a ratio of received signal compared to the strength of the test signal, or 
      in units of decibels (dB) down from the maximum main beam amplitude, and 
      such a map is called an Antenna Signal Response Map or more commonly an 
      Antenna Lobe Map. It is the main beamwidth on a lobe<IMG height=192

      width=294 align=left border=2 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> map that determines how 
      much signal enters the throat of a dish. The lobes on each side of the 
      main lobe, called sidelobes, are how off-axis noise enters a dish; and, of 
      course, direct line of sight TI comes straight in through the main beam. 
      Directional noise, coming into a dish in a side-ways fashion (see <A 
      href="http://www.geo-orbit.org/sizepgs/Noise.html#anchor122448">diagram 
      above</A>), can be controlled by using a dish with smaller side lobes, 
      i.e. the narrower a side lobe, in width, the less opening does noise have 
      to enter a dish. It is important to look at both the main lobe and side 
      lobe maps when considering dish selection. Looking at a lobe map, you can 
      see a broad beam brings in more signal (because it is more 'open') which 
      means the higher gain a dish has the broader its main beam is as well as 
      the broader its side lobes are. In summary, shallower dishes have broader 
      beams than deeper dishes, shallower dishes have slightly more gain than 
      deeper dishes, and shallower dishes let more noise enter into the system 
      than do deeper dishes. It is a fact of life and physics that dishes have 
      multiple lobe patterns so consider them when choosing your dish. Also, it 
      is important to note that the higher the frequency of reception, i.e. 
      Ku-band over C-band, the narrow the beam width (this is why Ku satellites 
      are more difficult to track than are C-band satellites). The beamwidth of 
      a Ku pattern will be one-third that of C-band because Ku frequency is 
      three times that of C-band frequency; beamwidth decreases as signal 
      frequency increases. Beamwidth also decreases as the size of the dish 
      increases which is why larger dishes are <IMG height=248

      to a smaller dish (see adjacent diagram on dish diameter vs. noise). In 
      general, the more narrow the main beamwidth the more narrow the 'window' 
      satellite signals have to enter the dish.</P>

      above</A>) and/or by offseting the center reception frequency of the 
      affected channel, especially on C-band, with minimal resulting picture 
      degradation. This is possible because the FCC (Federal Communications 
      Commission, USA) has allocated telephonic C-band carrier center 
      frequencies to be 10MHz above and below that allocated for satellite video 
      useage. Broader band single TI carriers are more difficult to notch 
      completely but you will be amazed at what a quality receiver can do with 
      TI which is why I had rather have a used Chaparral receiver than anything 
      new. Chaparral's internal filters are (were) the best. (NOTE: Wideband 
      (videoconferencing, data, and digital carriers) TI carriers usually cannot 
      be filtered with internal satellite receiver filters alone though you can 
      have some success using such filters in combination with a per channel

      <P><B><FONT size=+1>SUMMARY:</FONT></B> <A name=anchor4293380391></A>The 
      primary condition in any satellite system, of course, is receiving 
      sufficient signal to be above the noise floor. Despite meeting that 
      criteria, if terrestrial interference finds its way into the system it can 
      negate all the best efforts of installing quality equipment. In-band TI, 
      coming into the system through the LNB, can appear directly on top of the 
      satellite signal and also can be adjacent to the desired signal. 
      Out-of-band TI can invade the system through open connections and poor 
      grounding and can contribute to the noise floor and/or modulate itself on 
      the back of the received satellite or distribution signal. In-band TI is 
      best dealt with through appropriate choice of dish installation site. If 
      it is in the system, it.can be effectively filtered using the filters 
      internal to a quality satellite receiver in cases where it is an isolated 
      narrowband carrier; otherwise you can offset the center frequency of the 
      affected satellite channel and then apply filters. In a worst case 
      scenario, expensive filters, tuned to the exact frequency of the offending 
      TI signal, will need to be placed at the dish. For out-of-band TI, recheck 
      all system connections and be sure all open connector ends are terminated 
      and be sure all equipment is meant to be matched with each other as stated 
      by equipment manufacturers.<BR><B><I><A

      (SUN TRANSIT, SOLAR INTERFERENCE):</FONT></B> The ultimate <BR>noise, 
      solar outage. This is one of the items no one ever pays any attention to 
      except satellite service providers and owners of commercial installations 
      and then when it happens to you, as a homeowner, and your TV image goes 
      from excellent to sparkly to all snow you get a quick lesson in what it is 
      all about; it is a phenomenon unique to the satellite world. <BR><BR>Twice 
      a year, in the spring and the fall, coincident with the spring and fall 
      equinoxes (March 20/21 and September 20/21, i.e. when the seasons change), 
      the sun passes across the equator where it crosses (passes) directly 
      behind each satellite in the orbital belt. Remembering that the 
      directional beam of a ground station, i.e. satellite dish, is always set 
      to face a geostationary satellite, on the day when the sun is directly 
      behind an orbiting satellite it will cast a perfect shadow of the dish 
      feed assembly into the very center of the dish, i.e.when the main beam of 
      an earth station receiving antenna is in direct line of sight with the sun 
      it is when sun outage occurs. As the sun passes the antenna beam's field 
      of view, the ground station's receiver picks up the sun interference (as 
      transmitted through the feed assembly) and that causes a drastic 
      deterioration of the receive C/N (carrier to noise ratio); in other words, 
      it is all noise and no carrier. We also use S/N (signal to noise ratio) 
      equivalently with C/N. Basically, the satellite signal is overwhelmed by 
      the unwanted signal from the sun; the signal from the sun is what we call 
      noise. This phenomenon behaves as if the noise temperature rises in the 
      ground station's receiver.<BR><IMG height=257

      width=577 align=bottom border=0 NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>At this time, 
      until the sun moves, it will cause about ten minutes loss of signal from 
      that satellite. On the days before and after when the sun is directly 
      aligned with that satellite there will be less outage - as it approaches 
      alignment with a satellite, each day there is more outage than the 
      preceeding; and as it moves away from alignment with a satellite, each day 
      there is less outage. Of course, the actual days and times when your dish 
      will be affected depends on your latitude and longitude, longitudinal 
      position of the satellite, and diameter of the dish. For the March 
      equinox, solar outage begins in February, affecting the northernmost 
      latitudes, moving to affect the equator on the day of the equinox, and 
      ends in April, affecting the southernmost latitudes. For the September 
      equinox, the travel pattern of the sun is reversed so the pattern of solar 
      outage begins in the southernmost latitudes, in August, and ends at the 
      northernmost latitudes in October. Note that sun outage effects are vice 
      versa between the southern and northern hemispheres. For cases where a 
      ground station is located west of the affected satellite, sun interference 
      occurs in the morning; and for a ground station east of the affected 
      satellite, sun interference is in the afternoon.<BR><BR>If you have a 
      bright, shiny (or light colored), solid satellite dish, then the sun is 
      'cooking' your dish electronics so during periods of solar outage it is 
      best to move the dish to another location. Mesh antennas rarely have a 
      problem with overheated feed electronics during periods of solar outages. 
      The actual mechanics of solar outage are that the solar flux, which is 
      radiated in the 4 and 12 GHz frequency bands, introduces additional noise 
      into the antenna, forcing system noise temperature to rise. This occurs 
      because the satellite's weak coherent microwave streams become overwhelmed 
      in the microwave noise from the sun. In turn, this noise causes receivers 
      to operate near or below their threshold. Solar outage affects only the 
      downlink, not uplinks. <BR><BR>How adverse will be sun outages can be 
      determined with diameter of an antenna, signal margin of the ground 
      station, noise temperature of the receiver and noise inherent to the total 
      communication system. But beyond the esoteric calculations, we know that 
      diameter of a receive dish is related to quality of received signal; 
      specifically, dish gain increases proportionally to diameter of the dish 
      so the intensity of the effects of sun outages increases (is greater) in 
      larger dishes.<BR><BR>However, the larger diameter a receive antenna is, 
      the shorter time and the fewer days sun interferences last. We prove this 
      by the following formula: 'B = 0.5 + Bo' where 'B' is <IMG height=76

      </FONT>and noting the sun's declination changes 0.4 degree a day, the 
      maximum number of days the sun stays within the receive antenna's half 
      power beamwidth is: 'B degrees / 0.4 degrees/days'. A value of the receive 
      antenna's half power beamwidth, 'Bo', for typical parabolic antennas, 
      where wave length of receive frequency is 'L' and diameter of antenna is 
      'D', is predicted as follows: 'Bo = 70 x L / D' so that 'Bo' increases 
      with smaller dish diameters. (If you have ever tuned a large diameter dish 
      then you know that it is more difficult to tune than a smaller diameter 
      dish and that is because it is more focused in its center beam, i.e. its 
      half power beamwidth is smaller.) Therefore, the larger diameter a receive 
      antenna is, the shorter time and the fewer days sun interferences 
      last.<BR><BR><B><FONT size=+1><A
